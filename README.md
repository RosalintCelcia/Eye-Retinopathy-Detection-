# Eye-Retinopathy-Detection-
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model to detect eye retinopathy using segmentation techniques. The project leverages the UNet architecture with an EfficientNetB4 backbone to perform optic disc segmentation, enabling precise detection for medical imaging purposes.
